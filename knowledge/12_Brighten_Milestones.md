## Pediatric Notes

- Monitored for weight gain lag — under curve but developing strong otherwise  
- No signs of developmental delays or digestion concerns  
- Watch for next weight milestone: 12 lbs  
- Continue combo feeding and responsive play  
- Floor time remains key for next motor milestones

## Dad’s Notes

- Brighten is expressive, focused, and laughs easily  
- Loves music, being held chest-to-chest, and watching big brother Kyran  
- Starting to respond to his name and tone changes  
- Bonding strong — key goal is keeping development fun, not pressured
