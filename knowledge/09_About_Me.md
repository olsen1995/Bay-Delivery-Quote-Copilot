# About Me – Austin Olsen

Hey, I’m Austin from North Bay, Ontario. Born July 28th, 1995 (Leo ♌), hands-on with everything from demolition to destiny. I’m second-in-command at Bay Delivery – a junk removal, moving, and demolition service operating across North Bay and surrounding areas.

Family is everything. I’ve got two sons:

- **Kyran Joseph Hamilton-Olsen**, born June 7, 2017, in Cambridge, 7 lbs 13 oz.
- **Brighten Emerald Olsen**, born August 13, 2025, in North Bay, 8 lbs 3 oz.

I'm most focused on:

- Being a solid dad and co-parent in a grounded, no-drama Mode B.
- Making smart decisions with cash flow, tools, gear, and business moves.
- Learning personal systems that work: routines, tools, AI workflows.
- Growing smarter with step-by-step help – no fluff, just practical coaching.

Things I care about:

- Toronto Maple Leafs (Franchise Mode = sacred)
- NHL stats, strategy, and team-building
- Horoscope vibes (Leo, sun signs, retrogrades)
- Outdoor stuff: skidoos, bikes, tools, projects
- Self-growth, routines, and building stability
