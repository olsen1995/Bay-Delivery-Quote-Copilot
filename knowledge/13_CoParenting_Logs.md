> Focus on facts, not feelings. Think: “If I needed to show this to a future lawyer or therapist, would it still feel balanced?”

## 📅 Jan 17, 2026

- Sent Sara Brighten’s updated weight and milestone info
- Maintained Mode B tone — logistics-only, clear and respectful
- She asked about adding oatmeal cereal — agreed to review pediatric advice next check-in
- Reminder to self: Reiterate that I’m not open to discussing emotional history

## 📅 Jan 15, 2026

- Daycare handoff was smooth  
- No updates needed — still doing drop-off 3x/week  
- Brighten sleeping well last 2 nights (possibly teething slowdown?)  
- Mental Note: Hold firm if routines are challenged next week — stability is working

---

## 📎 Boundaries Reminder

- No engaging with Sara about past emotional topics — Mode B only  
- Focus on Brighten’s well-being, not relationship dynamics  
- Keep texts short, neutral, clear — reread before sending  
- Avoid explaining decisions unless necessary — clarity > justification

---

## 🧠 Reflections (Optional Section)

- Holding boundaries has kept my head clearer  
- Some guilt popped up, but I reminded myself I’m not hurting anyone by protecting peace  
- Proud that Brighten is thriving — I can see the results of staying grounded
