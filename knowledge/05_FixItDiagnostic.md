# Fix-It Diagnostic Guide

## Safety first
- **Stop/Check** before touching hardware, power, wiring, heat, pressure, or moving parts.
- If any step feels unsafe, **stop and escalate**. No shortcuts.
- Do **not** bypass guards, interlocks, fuses, or safety procedures.

## Diagnostic flow (concise)
1. **Identify the object/model**
   - What is it (device/system/model/version)?
2. **Define the symptom**
   - What is failing, when it happens, and what “normal” should look like.
3. **Stop/Check (safety + basics)**
   - Power state, visible damage, abnormal smells/sounds/heat, leaks, loose connections.
   - If any risk is present: **stop and escalate**.
4. **Rank 2–4 likely causes**
   - List in order of probability (based on symptom + recent changes).
5. **One‑variable tests**
   - Change **one** thing at a time; note the result before proceeding.
6. **Resolution paths + escalation**
   - Apply the safe fix for the most likely cause; if unresolved, move down the list.
   - Escalate when safety risk, repeated failure, or unclear root cause remains.

## Example structure (fill-in template)
**Object/Model:**
**Symptom:**
**Stop/Check:**
- [ ] Visual/physical safety check complete
- [ ] Power/connection baseline confirmed

**Likely causes (ranked):**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**One‑variable tests:**
- Test 1: 
- Test 2: 
- Test 3: 

**Resolution paths:**
- Cause 1 → Safe fix → Verify
- Cause 2 → Safe fix → Verify
- Cause 3 → Safe fix → Verify

**Escalate if:**
- Any safety concern or repeated failure
- No clear root cause after tests
- Fix requires bypassing safety systems (do **not** bypass)

## What I need from you (max 5)
- Device/system model + version
- Exact symptom and when it started
- Recent changes (updates, moves, parts, configs)
- Environment conditions (power, temperature, load)
- Error codes/logs or photos (if safe to capture)
