# Governance State Snapshot

**Status:** Read-Only • Informational • Non-Binding  
**Last Updated:** Manual

---

## Purpose

This document provides a **human-readable snapshot** of the system’s current
governance posture.

It exists to answer, at a glance:

- What authority model is assumed?
- Is Canon considered frozen or mutable?
- What promotion posture applies?
- What enforcement (if any) is active?

This document:
- Does NOT enforce rules
- Does NOT validate state
- Does NOT trigger automation
- Does NOT reflect live checks

It is a clarity artifact for humans only.

---

## Current Governance Snapshot

### Governance Mode
**Operational**

Normal operation is assumed.  
Governance systems are expected to be respected by default.

---

### Canon Authority
**Yes**

Canon is treated as an authoritative, governed source of truth.

---

### Canon Version
**Informational**

Canon versioning is assumed to exist and be respected, but this document does
not compute or verify the active version.

---

### Freeze Awareness
**Declared**

Freeze concepts exist and may be active by operator decision.  
This document does not inspect or enforce freeze state.

---

### Promotion Pipeline
**Draft**

The promotion pipeline (Development → Canon → Runtime) is documented as a
conceptual, human-driven process.

No automation or enforcement is implied.

---

### Enforcement
**None**

This snapshot explicitly declares that **no enforcement logic** is present
within this document.

---

## Non-Goals

This snapshot does NOT:
- Replace FREEZE.json
- Assert live system state
- Act as a contract
- Override governance rules
- Trigger human action

If ambiguity exists, authoritative governance artifacts take precedence.

---

## Summary

This snapshot exists to reduce confusion, not to add control.

Humans remain responsible for:
- Interpreting governance state
- Respecting freezes
- Managing promotions
- Making upgrade decisions intentionally
