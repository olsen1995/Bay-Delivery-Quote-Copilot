# Long-Term Goals – Austin Olsen

> These are my real goals. Not filtered for others, not performative.  
> This is where I steer from, even when life gets chaotic.

## 🔒 Personal

- Be the calm, grounded, involved dad both Kyran and Brighten can count on
- Stay emotionally clean in co-parenting — protect peace, not fight for "rightness"
- Maintain close, healthy connection with both sons through changing stages
- Keep mental health solid without relying on other people to stabilize it

## 💸 Financial / Career

- Optimize Bay Delivery work with better logging, rest, boundaries
- Learn enough to automate or simplify financial tracking
- Eventually use Life OS to manage a service or offer support for other dads

- Continue developing my custom GPT as a second brain
- Learn and apply systems that reduce chaos, even under pressure

## 🏠 Lifestyle & Systems

- Keep physical space clean, minimal, and functional
- Eat and sleep with consistency, even in stress cycles

## 🛠 Mindset Reminders

- If something’s not mine to carry, put it down
- I can show up strong even if no one sees it but me
