## ✅ Notes & Financial Priorities

- OW + jobs generally cover basics — side jobs keep things fluid  
- Cogeco bill must be paid **on time** to avoid service cutoff  
- Goal: build $100+ emergency buffer by spring  
- Optional: price out debt snowball if loans/arrears exist  
- Tip: consider tracking item resale income if it grows 🔄
