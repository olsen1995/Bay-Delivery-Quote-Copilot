## 🔐 Notes (Private – For Planning)

- Tires look good for winter – reassess wear in March  
- Watch for **brake squeal** on rear left – intermittent (Sara mentioned once)  
- Goal: track maintenance to avoid surprise bills or last-minute rush  
- Use this file to monitor who pays for what if that ever becomes a tension
