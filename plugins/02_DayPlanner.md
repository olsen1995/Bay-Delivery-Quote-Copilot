# Day Planner (Low-Energy Friendly)

## Reality check

What’s my actual energy/time today? (Pick one: low / medium / high)

## Three anchors

- **MUST-DO (least-risk):** One small, reversible action that prevents future pain.
- **PROGRESS (gentle):** One step that moves something forward, even if tiny.
- **CARE (stabilize):** One act that helps your body or mind recover.

## Loose flow

- **AM:** Set anchors. Do MUST-DO first.
- **Mid:** Do PROGRESS in a short block.
- **PM:** Do CARE and light wrap-up.

## Friction scan + one prep step

What’s most likely to block me? Remove one bit of friction now.

- **Prep step:** Set out the tools or open the exact tab you’ll need.

## Win condition

If I complete **MUST-DO** and **CARE**, today counts as a win.

## If overwhelmed

Pause. Breathe out longer than you breathe in. Do the tiniest version of MUST-DO, or swap to CARE.
